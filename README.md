# consensusSeekeR_demo
Here is a demo of consensusSeekeR, a tool available from Bioconductor that is used to call consensus peaks in ChIP seq replicates
(https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/consensusSeekeR.html)
Input files are in the form of *.narrowPeak and were obtained during ChIP seq peak calling using MACS2 on mouse chondrocyte data
The output *.bed file (chondrocyte_consensus_peaks_extend575.bed) is available for viewing with IGV (when viewing use mm10 as reference)
